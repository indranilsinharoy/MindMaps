A collection of mind maps. I regularly use (and update) the mind maps, as I learn something interesting or new about some topic of interest.

Software used to create the mind-maps: Docear (http://www.docear.org/) Docear is a free mind mapping tool, especially targeting the academic community.

You can also use the free and opensource mind mapping tool called Freeplane (http://freeplane.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to open the mind maps.

Please, feel free to use, modify and update the mind maps.

Here is a screenshot of a protion of one of the mindmaps to give you an idea of what to expect:
